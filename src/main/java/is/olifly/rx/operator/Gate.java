/**
 * Rx operator that functions similar to a filter with time restrictions.  The gate only lets values through
 * if they satisfy a threshold function for a certain amount of time. It can also be configured to let values
 * through after they stop satisfying the threshold function for a specified period of time.
 * <p>
 * A common use case for a gate is in audio data processing. The gate is usually configured to let audio data through
 * when the amplitude of the audio signal passes the threshold and stays there for a certain period of time. The audio
 * is also allowed to pass for a certain amount of time after is has dropped below the threshold amplitude in case the
 * amplitude picks up again to avoid unnecessary silences.
